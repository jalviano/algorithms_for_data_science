# Heavy Hitters

To solve the heavy hitters problem, follow these steps:

1. Download twitter stream data file from `https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall15/compsci590.4/assignment2/tweetstream.zip`
and include in `hw_1` folder along with `count_min_sketch.py`.
2. To generate heavy-hitters, run `python3 count_min_sketch.py -A <algorithm>` where `<algorithm>` can be `a` to use the
simple frequency algorithm in question 5a and `b` to use the count-min sketch algorithm in question 5b.
3. The list of heavy hitters will printed to the console.
